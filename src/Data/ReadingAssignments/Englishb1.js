    Title: 'An Adventure in London',
    readingText: "Liam always dreamed of visiting London, the city of red buses, historic towers, and magical stories. One bright Saturday, his dream came true! His first stop was Big Ben, the giant clock that seemed to touch the sky. As the bells rang, Liam felt like he had stepped into a movie. Next, he hopped onto a famous red double-decker bus and rode to The Tower of London, where he heard thrilling tales of kings, queens, and even prisoners! Inside the tower, he saw the sparkling Crown Jewels—they were more dazzling than he had imagined. \nLater, Liam went to The Globe Theatre, a place filled with stories from William Shakespeare. Standing on the wooden stage, he pretended to be a great actor performing in front of a cheering crowd. His last stop was The British Museum, where he saw treasures from around the world, like a real Egyptian mummy and a Rosetta Stone. As the day ended, Liam looked at the city lights from the London Eye and thought, “London is truly magical!” He promised himself he’d return to explore more of its secrets.",
